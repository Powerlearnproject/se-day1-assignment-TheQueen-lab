Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a discipline that applies engineering principles to software development. It involves designing, developing, testing, deploying andmaintaining software systems in a structured and efficient manner.Software engineering drives technological advancements by developing applications, platforms, and systems that power industries like healthcare, finance, and education.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The birth of software engineering (1968), the rise of structured programming (1970s-1980s) and the advent of Agile methodology (2001)

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning which includes the project's goals,scope and budget. Requirement analysis meaning functional and non functional requirements are defined. Design, system architecture and software design are created. Implementation, this is when developers write and test code based on the design specifications, then software is tested for bugs, perfomance, and security issues.The software is released to users in a production environment, deployment can be done in phases, such as beta testing or full release. Updates, bug fixes, and perfomance improvements are made, new features may be added based on user feedback.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall offers minimal customer involvement after intial planning phase while Agile methodologies offers high customer involvement with frequent feedback for examples requirements are clear from the start, and minimal changes are expected.
 
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer is responsible for designing, developing, and maintaining software applications.A Quality Assurance Engineer ensures that the software meets quality standards before it is released to users and they are also responsible for writing and executing test plans and test cases. Project Manager oversees the software development process, ensuring timely and successful project completion.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An IDE is a software application that provides developers with tools for writing, debuggin, and managing code efficiently, examples of IDEs includes Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA and PyCharm. A VCS tracks and manages changes in code, enabling collaboration and maintaining a history of modifiaction, examples of VCS includes Git, Github, and GitLab and Bitbucket.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
The software industry evolves quickly, requiring continuous learning, engineers can stay updated with online courses, blogs, and tech conferences.
Identifying and fixing software issues can be time consuming and fustrating, inorder to avoide this they can use debugging tools and log files to track issues effieciently.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing tests individual components or functions of the software in isolation, it helps detect  bugs early in the development cycle. Integration testing tests the interaction between multiple components or modules, it ensures that different modules communicate correctly. System testing tests the entire application as a whole to verify that it meets requirements, it validates overall system behavior and perfomance. Acceptance testing evaluates whether the software meets business requirements and is ready for release, it confirms that the software meets user needs and expactations.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining inputs to optimize responses from AI models like CHATGP. It involves structuring queries effectively to achieve accurate, relevant, and high-quality results. Well crafted prompts reduce ambiguity, leading to more precise and relevant AI-generator. It optimizes prompts to reduce back-and-forth, interactions, saving time and effort.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"Tell me about cars"
Improves Prompt:
Expllain the differences between eletric and gasoline-power cars, including their enviroment,cost and perfomance. The improved prompt is more effective because it specifies the focus on eletric vs gasoline cars instead of just "cars"
